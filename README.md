# Java-DSA

Welcome! 👋 This repository is where I’m documenting my journey through Java programming and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). It's a hands-on approach to strengthening my fundamentals while preparing for coding interviews.

## 🚀 What’s Inside
This repo covers Java basics with working examples. As I go deeper into DSA, I'll keep expanding it.

### ✅ Topics so far:
- Java syntax & boilerplate
- Variables and data types
- Input/Output in Java
- Writing clean comments
- Type Casting, Converion & Promotion
- Simple Programs (Sum, Product, Area, etc.)
- Operators
- Conditional Statements
- Loops
- Patterns(Part1)
- Functions/Methods

More topics (like arrays, recursion, OOP, and DSA problems) coming soon.
