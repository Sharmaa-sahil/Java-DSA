# Java-DSA

Welcome! 👋 This repository is where I’m documenting my journey through Java programming and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). It's a hands-on approach to strengthening my fundamentals while preparing for coding interviews.

## 🚀 What’s Inside
This repo covers Java basics with working examples. As I go deeper into DSA, I'll keep expanding it.

### ✅ Topics so far:
- Java syntax & boilerplate
- Variables and data types
- Input/Output in Java
- Writing clean comments
- Sum of two
- Product of two
- Area of circle
- Type Casting, Converion & Promotion

More topics (like arrays, recursion, OOP, and DSA problems) coming soon.
