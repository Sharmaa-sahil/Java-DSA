// Functions / Methods in Java

//What is a Method?
// A block of code that performs a specific task, reusable anywhere in the program.

/*
Types of Methods

Predefined methods → already provided by Java.
Example: System.out.println(), Math.sqrt()

User-defined methods → you create them. */


/*
Why Functions?

Break large program → small parts.

Avoid repetition.

Increases readability & reusability. */
